## Project Description

This single-day work planner allows users to write down and save their tasks and appointments for the day and save it to their browser's local storage.

* **Motivation** Having just been introduced to various web and third-party APIs, libraries, and frameworks, this project was heavily motivated by the exploration of APIs and Javascript libraries.

* **Solutions** This applications provides a straight-forward and easy to assemble daily scheduler that a person can use or replicate in their own applications or for their own personal use.

* **Application** This demonstrated to me the wide range of applications for third party APIs and JavaScript libraries. It demonstrates that efficient web applications and skillful developers know how and when to utilize open source resources, APIs, frameworks and libraries to produce useful and compelling products.
